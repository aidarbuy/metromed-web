There were even things for my four year old to do in the room while I was being examined. Trish was knowledgable and her bedside manner was fabulous. You can also send your prescriptions to your regular pharmacy (unlike another urgent care close by that makes you fill on-site) and after starting my treatments I am starting to feel better! Thanks! We will certainly be back here!",
